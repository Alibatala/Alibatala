 💻 About Me

I'm a passionate and curious developer in the making, diving deep into the world of modern **Web & App Development**. I love exploring new technologies and continuously expanding my skills.

💡 I'm always eager to learn — whether it's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or how to structure and build responsive websites and apps.

🎨 In my free time, I enjoy exploring **Graphic Design** and watch short, insightful tutorials on web development — from building clean HTML structures to using advanced elements and tags.

My goal is to become a full-stack developer while keeping a strong creative edge through design.
